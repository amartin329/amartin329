# Hi there!
I am a recent full-stack bootcamp graduate and current solo-developer. I'm currently working on adding functionality to my meal-planning app, MÃ«lr, but expect other projects to appear here soon!

## Skills
### Front-End
JavaScript, Vue.js, React, HTML, CSS
### Back-End
Java, PostgreSQL, Spring Boot, JUnit


## Projects
### MÃ«lr | Meal Planning Application
A full-stack meal planning application that uses a Java/Spring Boot back-end and a JavaScript/Vue.js front-end. Users can use ingredients sourced from a Web API (Spoonacular) to create their own library of recipes, meals, and meal plans. Users can create a weekly schedule of meal plans and add all required ingredients to a grocery list.

**Currently working on:**
1. Restructuring database
2.  Recipe sharing between users
3. Allowing users to create custom tags for recipes
4. Improved styling

> [!NOTE]
> The below projects were completed as part of my bootcamp curriculum - as such, they are private.
### Online Payment Service Application
A Java-based online payment service application that allows authenticated users to send and receive payments to each other. The application utilizes client-server programming to manage user accounts, balances, and transfers between users.
### CLI Vending Machine Application
A Java-based CLI program that simulates the operations of a vending machine, including inventory, transactions, and logging.

## Looking to learn more about:
1. AWS
2. Front-End Libraries
3. C#
4. Python
